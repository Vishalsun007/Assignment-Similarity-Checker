# Assignment-Similarity-Checker

An "Assignment Similarity Checker" typically refers to a tool or software used to assess the originality of a piece of writing by comparing it against a database of existing content to identify similarities or matches. These tools are commonly used in educational institutions to detect plagiarism in student submissions, as well as by researchers and writers to ensure the integrity of their work.
